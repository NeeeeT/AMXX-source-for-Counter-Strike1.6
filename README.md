Hello, I'm Nailaz.

I would like to share my Amxmodx scripts for Counter-Strike 1.6 with you. These scripts are in the .sma file format (source code), and you can use the amxx compiler to compile them into .amxx files. All of the scripts are public and coded by me. If you encounter any problems or bugs, feel free to contact me.
