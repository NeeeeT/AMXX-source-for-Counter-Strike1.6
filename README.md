------------------------------------
- Weapons Level System info:

The script / plugin source added extra feature for cs1.6 weapons.
You can use its APIs to achieve many things like adding weapon's damage depend on its level.
All of its level and exp will autosave during the game. 

------------------------------------

- Top3 Damage Dealer info:

This shows the name of top3 damage dealer within a round, with HUD list form.
There's some cvars about it in the script like x-axis, y-axis and colors setting.
Every new round will update its top3 name and dmg var.

------------------------------------

- Main LevelSystem

------------------------------------

It's a simple but very useful and creative plugin that makes cs1.6 more like a RPG game.
Here's level, exp, cash, gold, etc. all variable provided will be autosaved.
The source contains many API so that you can use them to attain many funny things.
*the plugin also has a limit on player's changing name function, since the player's var was saved by game name.
